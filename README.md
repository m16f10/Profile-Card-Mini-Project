# Profile-Card-Mini-Project

The Profile Card Mini Project is a hands-on exercise in mastering essential CSS concepts and techniques.
Inspired by a tutorial from @dave_ray, this project covers key aspects of web development, including CSS Grid, Flexbox, positioning, media queries, and image styling.

## Tutorial Highlights

- **CSS Techniques:** Explore the effective use of CSS Grid, Flexbox, and positioning for creating a well-structured layout.

# CSS Structure:

- Import fonts using @import in the head of the document.
- Apply a reset for a consistent baseline.
- Set the display of visible images to block for proper styling.
- Utilize utility classes like nowrap to control text behavior.
- Define general styles for HTML elements such as body, html, header, nav, main, and footer.

# Responsive Design:
Implement media queries for responsiveness based on device sizes. Ensure a smooth user experience across various devices.

# Landscape Mode:
Include a media query specifically for landscape mode to handle devices that are rotated.

# Color Palette:
I've customized the color palette to give the project a unique look and feel for using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).

The project now features the following colors:

- dark Color: #424874
- Accent Color: #dcd6f7
